# Projected SOR
This is a generalization of SOR for solving linear complementarity problems,
which characterize American options. Here we write out our PDE in *linear
complementarity formulation*, and then we can slightly modify our SOR algorithm
to price American options. Error checking is an interesting issue since the
pricing of American options don't have closed-form solutions.

... I'll figure something out.
